# My First Year Python Projects

During my first year at the university, I embarked on several Python projects that significantly enhanced my understanding and proficiency in Python. These projects not only helped me grasp the fundamentals of Python but also allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. Here are some of the noteworthy projects I worked on:

## Bataille_Navale_v2.0

This project involved developing a version of the classic game "Battleship". It was a great exercise in understanding how to manipulate data structures and implement game logic in Python.

## Snake Game

Building the Snake Game from scratch was an exciting challenge. It helped me understand how to handle user inputs and game states, and how to work with graphics in Python.

## SimpleChat

The SimpleChat project was about creating a basic chat application. This project gave me insights into network programming and handling real-time data in Python.

## Processing_CSV_file

The Processing_CSV_file project involved creating web pages using HTML and CSS codes present in `code.html` and `style.css` files. The pages displayed summaries of mobile network antennas divided by categories such as operator, technology, system, and installation status. For each operator category, a page was created to present its data. The dataset used six columns: operator name, technology type, creation date, generation, coordinates, and installation status. The total number of antennas was calculated and filtered according to the above categories.

These projects played a pivotal role in my Python learning journey during my first year at the university.
